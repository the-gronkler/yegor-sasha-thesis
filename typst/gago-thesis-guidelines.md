## 3. Bibliography and references

IEEE stands for "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers."
It is an international professional organization for engineers working in the fields of electrical and electronic
technology.

IEEE has issued its own citation and reference guidelines, which are often used in technical literature, especially
in publications related to electrical engineering and computer science. IEEE is a format for bibliography and
references that should be used in engineering work.

## 3.1. In-Text Citations

In the IEEE style, in-text citations are indicated by numbers in square brackets. The numbers correspond to the
full reference in the bibliography at the end of the document. The citation numbers are ordered by the sequence in
which they first appear in the text.

**Example**

```
According to recent studies, machine learning has a significant impact on data analysis [1].
Another study confirms this finding [2].
```

## 3.2. Reference List

The reference list should be numbered according to the order of appearance in the text. Each reference entry
should start with the citation number in square brackets.

## 3.3. Common IEEE Citation Formats with Examples

## 3.4. Combining Multiple References in a Sentence

You can combine multiple citations in a single sentence by listing the citation numbers together within the square
brackets.

Example

## 3.5. Tips for Using IEEE Style

```
Several studies have examined this phenomenon [3], [5], [8].
```

```
Ordering : Ensure the reference list is in the order of citation appearance, not alphabetical order.
Consistency : Keep the formatting consistent throughout the document.
Authors : For up to six authors, list all names. For more than six, list the first author followed by "et al."
```

## 4.0 Abbreviation

**First appearance of an abbreviation:** When introducing an abbreviation for the first time in the text, you should
first provide the full form followed by the abbreviation in parentheses. For example: "The Central Executive
Committee (CEC) decided to..." In the rest of the text, you can use only the abbreviation: "The CEC approved the
new regulations."

**Well-known abbreviations:** Some abbreviations are widely recognized and accepted, even if they haven't been
previously introduced in the text. For example: "USA," "NATO," "UN." In most cases, you don't need to expand
such abbreviations unless the context requires it.

## 5. Formal Writing Voice

https://facultyweb.ivcc.edu/rrambo/tip_formal_writing_voice.htm

Have you ever attended an event in which "formal" attire is expected? You probably did not wear old jeans with
holes in the knees, a stained tee shirt promoting your favorite beverage, and a pair of sandals. You probably
chose more formal attire.

If you were giving an important speech to a group of people you do not know, would you use the same kind of
language you use when talking with friends? Probably not. Recognizing your lack of familiarity with the audience,
the importance of the occasion, your desire to demonstrate your knowledge of the subject, and the impression
you would like to make, you would probably use a more formal voice for your speech than what you would use
when talking with close friends.

For all of the essays you write for this course, you should use a formal writing voice. You should use the kind of
language you would use when giving an important speech, not the kind of language you might use when talking
with close friends. A formal tone helps establish the writer's respect for the audience and suggests that the writer
is serious about his or her topic. It is the kind of tone that educated people use when communicating with other
educated people. Most academic writing uses a formal tone.

**The following guidelines should help you maintain a formal writing voice in your essays.**

### 5.1. Do not use first-person pronouns ("I," "me," "my," "we," "us," etc.)

Using these expressions in analytical and persuasive essays can make the writing wordy, can make the writer
seem less confident of his or her ideas, and can give the essay an informal tone. Use of first-person pronouns is
unnecessary in the kinds of essays you are writing for the course. Readers will know that they are reading your
thoughts, beliefs, or opinions, so you do not need to state, "I think that," "I believe that," or "in my opinion." Simply
delete these expressions from sentences, and you will be left with stronger sentences.

**Example**
I think that this character is confused.
This character is confused.
(The second sentence is less wordy, sounds more formal, and conveys a more confident tone.)

"One," "the reader," "readers," "the viewer," or something similar sometimes can be used effectively in place of
first-person pronouns in formal papers, but be careful not to overuse these expressions. You want to sound
formal, not awkward and stiff.

**Example**
I can sense the character's confusion.
Readers can sense the character's confusion.

### 5.2. Avoid addressing readers as "you."

Addressing readers using second-person pronouns ("you, your") can make an essay sound informal and can
bring assumptions into an essay that are not true. A student once wrote in her essay, "If you wear a tube top, guys
might think that you are easy." I wondered why the student would think that I, a male, would wear a tube top. As
with first-person pronouns, second-person pronouns can be replaced by words such as "one," "the reader,"
"readers," and "the viewer."

### 5.3. Avoid the use of contractions

Contractions are shortened versions of words that use apostrophes in place of letters, such as "can't," "isn't,"
"she's," and "wouldn't." The more formal, non-contracted versions are "cannot," "is not," "she is," and "would not."
You might be surprised by how much better a sentence can sound if non-contracted versions of the words replace
the contractions.

**Example**
The character isn't aware that he's surrounded by people he can't trust.
The character is not aware that he is surrounded by people he cannot trust.

Making your writing more formal by avoiding contractions is easy: just find the contractions and replace them with
the non-contracted versions of the words.

### 5.4. Avoid colloquialism and slang expressions

Colloquial diction is informal language used in everyday speech and includes such words as "guys," "yeah,"
"stuff," "kind of," "okay," and "big deal." Highly informal diction, such as "freak out" and "dissing," falls into the
category of "slang." While slang words often are vivid and expressive, slang comes and goes quickly, another
reason why slang should be avoided in formal writing. Both colloquialism and slang expressions convey an
informal tone and should be avoided in formal writing.

**Example**
The guy was nailed for ripping off a liquor store.
The man was convicted of robbing a liquor store.

As you avoid informal language, be careful not to use words that suggests ideas that you may not intend. "The
gentleman was convicted of robbing a liquor store" would probably leave readers wondering why the man who
robbed the store is considered to be a "gentleman." Likewise, "the lady was convicted of robbing a liquor store"
would probably cause readers to wonder why a woman who robs a liquor store is considered to be a "lady."

### 5.5. Avoid nonstandard diction

Nonstandard diction refers to expressions that are not considered legitimate words according to the rules of
Standard English usage. Nonstandard diction includes "ain't," "theirselves," "hisself," "anyways," "alot" (the
accepted version is "a lot"), and "alright" (the accepted version is "all right"). Most good dictionaries will identify
such expressions with the word "Nonstandard." Because nonstandard expressions generally are not regarded as
legitimate words, I mark these expressions in essays as examples of "inaccurate word choice."

### 5.6. Avoid abbreviated versions of words

For example, instead of writing "photo," "phone" and "TV," write "photograph," "telephone," and "television."

### 5.7. Avoid the overuse of short and simple sentences

While the writer might use formal diction in such sentences, too many short and simple sentences can make an
essay sound informal, as if the writer is not recognizing that the audience is capable of reading and understanding
more complex and longer sentences. Short and simple sentences can be used effectively in formal writing, but
heavy reliance on such sentences reflects poorly on the writer and gives the writing an informal tone.

### 5.8. Final Comments

Do not confuse formal diction with presumptuous diction (the kind of language that seems intended mainly to
impress readers) or jargon (the kind of language only familiar to people within a specialized field, such as
computer technicians).

You should not sound "artificial" as you use formal diction. Instead, consider that different situations require
different uses of language and that educated people are able to adapt their use of language to a variety of writing
and speaking situations. Educated people have several different writing and speaking voices, and one voice is no
more "genuine" than another. Instead, the different voices reflect choices based on the writing or speaking
situation. Through your word choice in essays, you can portray yourself as an intelligent person who is aware of
your audience--a group of well-educated people whom you do not know. Imagine the kind of language that you
might use in a job interview for an important job. With formal diction, you can express yourself clearly, accurately,
and effectively, without relying on the kind of language that you might use in less formal situations.

## 6. Table of content

**The table of contents should be numbered** – for example:

1. Introduction
2. Literature Review
3. Research Methodology
4. Data Analysis
5. Conclusion
6. References

## 7. Table of content - final thesis structure

The following list present the table of content for the first phase of **the documentation (analysis phase).**

The presented table of contents can be expanded. For example, the functional requirements section can be
divided into subsections.

1. Title Page
2. Glossary – optional
3. Introduction
4. Aims and Objectives
5. Context
6. Functional Requirements
7. Use Case Diagram
8. Use Case Scenarios
9. Non-Functional Requirements
10. Additional chapters if necessary - depending on the diploma topic

## 8. Introduction - description (usually 1-3 pages)

The introduction is one of the key elements of any engineering thesis. Its main purpose is to introduce the reader
to the topic of the work, present the main assumptions, and outline the research objectives. The introduction
should be written clearly and concisely so that the reader immediately understands what to expect in the rest of
the text.

The introduction should serve as a comprehensive summary of the entire diploma project. It should clearly state
the main aim, outline the problem-solving approach, and present the key outcomes. Since the introduction reflects
the essence of the whole project, it is typically written at the end of the study, once all research and analysis have
been completed. This ensures that the introduction accurately captures all aspects of the project, providing the
reader with a clear understanding of what was achieved and how it was accomplished.

## 9. Aims and objectives (1-2 pages)

The aim should be concise and specific. It’s important that it is clearly defined and measurable. It should highlight
the business benefits that will result from implementing the application. Additionally, it should reflect the business
needs and challenges that the application is intended to address. The application can have multiple aims, and it's
also possible to break down the main aim into smaller, more focused objectives.

By ensuring that the aim is both clear and tied to measurable outcomes, it becomes easier to evaluate the
success of the project in achieving its intended goals.

**Well-defined aims:**

**Examples of poorly defined business aims:**

```
"The aim is to reduce delivery time by 15% through efficient real-time parcel tracking."
"The project aims to increase sales efficiency by 20% through improved customer segmentation."
```

```
"I would like to create an application that helps companies." – too vague, lacks measurability.
"I intend to create an application that will be popular among businesses." – too subjective, lacks a specific
business benefit.
"My aim is to deliver business value." – too broad in scope, lacks specific benefits and measurability.
```

**Objectives** are specific, actionable steps that help achieve the overall aim of the project. They break down the
aim into smaller, manageable tasks that are measurable and time-bound. While the aim outlines what you want to
achieve, objectives provide a clear roadmap on how to reach that goal, often specifying the methods, resources,
and milestones necessary to accomplish it.

**Example**

**Aim of the project:**
To increase employee productivity by 10% and reduce the time required for HR processes by 20% through the
development of an intuitive and scalable web application.

**Objectives:**

**Market and user needs analysis:**
a) Conduct research among small businesses to determine their needs related to human resource management.
b) Analyse existing applications on the market with similar purposes.

**Application design:**
a) Create a prototype of the application based on research results and best UX/UI practices.
b) Gather feedback on the prototype from potential users and make the necessary adjustments.

**Application implementation:**
a) Select appropriate technologies for building the application.
b) Code the main functions of the application with consideration for security and performance.
c) Test the application for errors and usability.

**Deployment and evaluation:**
a) Release the application to a selected group of small businesses.
b) Collect user feedback after the testing period.
c) Evaluate the achievement of the project's aim based on the collected data and feedback.

# 10. Context ( 4 - x pages)

## 10.1. Business context of the project

The context of the project refers to the broader background and environment in which the research or project is
conducted. It helps the reader understand why the given topic was undertaken and what external factors may
influence the development and functioning of the designed system.

Below are the detailed elements that make up the context of a project involving the creation of a human resource
management application for small businesses.

**Example:**
_Human resource management in small businesses is crucial to their success. However, many companies face
challenges in this area due to a lack of access to effective tools. The growing interest in digitizing business
processes and the need for automation of HR processes in small companies have become the basis for
undertaking this project._

It's valuable to provide references to external sources/bibliographic positions here.

**External factors related to the project**
External factors related to the project refer to the various elements outside the project itself that can influence its
development, implementation, and overall success. These factors include stakeholders such as business owners,
HR managers, and end-users who will interact with or be affected by the project. They also encompass existing
systems and technologies that the project may need to integrate with, such as HR software, accounting systems,
or project management tools. Additionally, external processes like recruitment, training, or payroll workflows can
impact how the project is designed and implemented. Regulatory requirements, industry standards, and relevant
laws (such as data protection regulations like GDPR) also play a crucial role, as they may impose constraints or
specific requirements on the project's functionality. Lastly, unforeseen events or changes in the business
environment, such as market trends or technological advancements, may influence the project's direction, making
it essential to consider these external factors throughout the project lifecycle.

**People (Stakeholders):** Owners of small businesses, HR managers, IT department staff, end-users of the
application, and potential investors.
**Other systems:** Existing HR applications that the new system can integrate with, accounting systems, project
management systems, etc.
**Processes:** Recruitment processes, performance evaluations, training and development, payroll processes, and
other HR processes.
**Events:** External events that may impact our system.
**Documents:** Previous research on human resource management, industry standards, technical documentation of
systems with which the application will interact. Laws or other regulations that may affect our application (e.g.,
GDPR).

### 10.2. Sources and Sinks

In the context of our project, it is important to clearly describe the **external sources** and **sinks** (if they exist) that
interact with the application. **External sources** may include employee data from legacy HR systems, feedback
collected from employees through surveys, and financial data obtained from accounting systems. These sources
provide the necessary inputs for the application to function effectively. Conversely, **external sinks** refer to the
destinations where the processed data will be stored or utilized, such as an external database for maintaining
employee information and files that record personal data. Understanding these external sources and sinks will
help ensure seamless integration and efficient data flow within the application.

**Sources:**

**Sinks:**

```
Employee data from previous HR systems.
Feedback from employees through surveys.
Financial data from accounting systems.
```

```
An external database for the application to store employee information.
A file that records personal data.
```

### 10.3. Competition analysis

In the context chapter, it is also important to include an analysis of competitive applications. A competitive analysis
allows for the identification and understanding of existing functional requirements, as well as the discovery of
potential gaps and unmet market needs. This enables the delivery of a product that stands out against the
competition by offering unique features or better service quality. Therefore, a thorough analysis of competitive
applications is not only a valuable source of information.

## 11. Functional requirements

Functional requirements in the context of a web application specify the specific functions and actions that the
application should perform in response to certain user requests or under specific conditions. These are clearly
defined specifications describing the system's behavior, such as the ability to log in, add products to a shopping
cart, or process payments. In short, functional requirements define "what" the application should do, rather than
"how" it should do it. They serve as the foundation for designing, coding, and testing the application. This chapter
should be described from the client's perspective. We can divide it into subsections or use a bulleted list. It is
important that the descriptions are comprehensive and contain all the necessary information.

### 11.1. Good practices

```
Be Precise and Clear: Functional requirements should be articulated clearly and precisely. Each
requirement must be understandable without ambiguity so that anyone reading them—developers, testers, or
stakeholders—can implement the application correctly. Avoid vague terms and use specific language to
define what the application must do.
Use Measurable Criteria: Requirements should include measurable criteria wherever possible. This allows
for effective verification and validation during the testing phase. For instance, instead of saying "the
application should be fast," specify "the application should do X within three seconds."
Focus on User Needs: Describe the requirements from the end user's perspective. This ensures that the
functionalities align with user needs and expectations. For example, specify that users should be able to
reset their passwords easily and intuitively, enhancing user experience.
Organize Requirements Logically: Structure the requirements in a logical order. You can categorize them
by functionality, user roles, or business processes. Using subsections or bullet points can help make the
information more digestible and easier to navigate.
Prioritize Requirements: Not all requirements carry the same weight. Prioritize them based on business
value or user impact. This helps stakeholders focus on the most critical features first, facilitating better
resource allocation during development.
Include Edge Cases and Constraints: Address edge cases and any constraints that might affect the
application’s functionality. This could include limitations based on technology, regulations, or user roles. It
ensures a more robust understanding of the application's operational environment.
Review and Validate Requirements: Regularly review the requirements with stakeholders to ensure they
remain aligned with business goals and user needs. Validation sessions help uncover any gaps or
misunderstandings early in the development process.
```

### 11.2. Kano model

The **Kano model** is a framework that helps organizations understand and prioritize customer requirements by
categorizing them into different types based on their impact on customer satisfaction. Developed by Professor
Noriaki Kano in the 1980s, this model provides valuable insights into how different features of a product or service
influence customer perceptions. Here’s how the Kano model can help in understanding requirements:

```
Basic Needs (Must-Be Requirements):
These are the essential features that customers expect. If these requirements are not met, customers
will be dissatisfied, but meeting them does not significantly increase satisfaction.
Example: In a web application, basic requirements might include user authentication and data security.
Performance Needs (One-Dimensional Requirements):
These features have a linear relationship with customer satisfaction; the better you perform in these
areas, the more satisfied the customer will be. They are typically competitive differentiators.
Example: Fast loading times or an intuitive user interface; the faster and easier the application is to
use, the higher the customer satisfaction.
Excitement Needs (Delighters):
These are features that customers do not expect but can significantly enhance satisfaction if present.
They can set a product apart from the competition.
Example: A unique feature, such as personalized recommendations based on user behavior, can
delight users and create a positive impression.
Indifferent Needs:
These features do not significantly affect customer satisfaction whether they are present or not.
Customers are indifferent to their inclusion.
Example: Certain aesthetic aspects that do not influence functionality or usability might fall into this
category.
Reverse Needs:
```

- These are features that, if present, may lead to dissatisfaction among some customers. It’s crucial to
  understand the target audience to avoid these features.
- **Example:** Overly complicated processes or too many features can overwhelm users, leading to frustration.

### 11.3. How to gather requirements?

```
Definition based on conversations with the client
Surveys
User observation
Analysis of competitive applications
Analysis of legacy applications
Brainstorming / Event storming (requirement discovery sessions)
Mind mapping
```

## 12. Nonfunctional requirements

Non-functional requirements in the context of an application refer to aspects related to the quality and properties
of the system, rather than its direct functions. They pertain to areas such as performance, security, availability,
scalability, and user interface. In practice, they define "how well" the application performs its functions.

Examples include system response time, maximum number of concurrent users, and compliance with specific
standards. Non-functional requirements are crucial for ensuring user satisfaction and the application's success in
the market.

**Performance-related requirements:**

**Security-related requirements (accountability, authenticity, confidentiality, integrity):**

**Reliability-related requirements (availability, fault tolerance, recoverability):**

**Usability-related requirements (accessibility, learnability, ease of use):**

**Maintainability-related requirements (reusability, analyzability, changeability, testability):**

**Portability-related requirements (adaptability, installability, replaceability):**

```
The application must be capable of handling 10,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
The loading time for the homepage must not exceed 3 seconds on a standard internet connection.
```

```
Accountability: All user actions must be logged in system logs with the appropriate user identifier.
Authenticity: Users must undergo two-factor authentication during login.
Confidentiality: Users' personal data must be encrypted using the AES-256 standard.
Integrity: Financial transactions must be protected against unauthorized modification.
```

```
Availability: The application must be available with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 99.9%.
Fault Tolerance: The system must be able to continue operating despite the failure of one of the servers.
Recoverability: In the event of a failure, the system must be able to restore data from the last 24 hours
within 2 hours.
```

```
Accessibility: The application must meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards.
Learnability: New users must be able to master the basic functions of the application within 30 minutes.
Ease of Use: 95% of users must rate the interface as intuitive in usability studies.
```

```
Reusability: The application components must be designed in a modular way to allow for their repeated use
in different parts of the system.
Analyzability: Error codes and system logs must be clear and easy to interpret for developers.
Changeability: Software updates must be deployable without causing system downtime.
Testability: The application should ensure 95% coverage with unit/integration tests for the server
application.
```

```
Adaptability: The application must function correctly on both Windows and macOS systems.
Installability: The installation of the application must be possible for users without specialized technical
knowledge and should not take longer than 15 minutes.
Replaceability: The application must be compatible with existing ABC-class systems, allowing for easy
replacement if necessary.
```

### 12.1. Nonfunctional requirements should be SMART

SMART is an acronym used to describe a methodology for formulating clear and measurable goals or
requirements. Although initially applied mainly in project management and personal coaching, the term can also
be utilized for formulating non-functional requirements in software design. In the context of non-functional
requirements, SMART can help ensure that the requirements are clear, measurable, and achievable.

### Breakdown of SMART:

By applying the SMART criteria, teams can develop robust non-functional requirements that guide the design and
implementation process effectively.

**S (Specific) – Specific:** The requirement should be clearly defined and specifically outline the expected behavior
of the system. Instead of saying, "The application should perform quickly," it's better to state, "The loading time for
the homepage must not exceed 3 seconds."

**M (Measurable) – Measurable:** The requirement should be measurable, meaning it can be assessed and verified
to determine whether it has been met. For example: "The application must support up to 10,000 concurrent
users."

**A (Achievable) – Achievable:** Requirements must be realistic and attainable, considering the available
resources, technologies, and time constraints.

**R (Relevant) – Relevant:** Non-functional requirements should be important to the project and aligned with user
needs and business objectives.

**T (Time-bound) – Time-bound:** While it may not always be possible for non-functional requirements, it's
beneficial to set timeframes for certain requirements, such as "The system must be able to restore data from the
last 24 hours within 2 hours after a failure."

## 13. Getting more precise

Functional requirements are typically written in natural language, which can sometimes lead to imprecision.
Because of this inherent ambiguity, it is common practice to follow the formulation of functional requirements with
the creation of use case diagrams and use case scenarios. These tools help present the information in a more
precise and concise manner, clearly illustrating how users will interact with the system and outlining the expected
behaviors and outcomes.

In addition to enhancing clarity, use case diagrams and scenarios can serve as valuable communication tools
among stakeholders, ensuring that everyone has a shared understanding of the system's functionality. This
structured approach ultimately contributes to more effective development and testing processes.

## 14. Actors and use case diagram

A **use case diagram** is one of the diagrams in UML (Unified Modeling Language) used to represent the
functionality of a system from the user's perspective. It focuses on "what" the system is supposed to do rather
than "how" it will achieve those functions.

Use case diagrams visually depict the interactions between users (actors) and the system, highlighting the various
use cases or functionalities available to the users. This helps stakeholders understand the system's requirements
and how different actors will interact with it. By clearly illustrating the relationships and interactions, use case
diagrams facilitate communication among developers, designers, and clients, ensuring everyone has a shared
understanding of the system's intended functionalities.

## 14.1. Use case example

Create use case diagram for the following requirements:
_When placing an order, the user has the option to select an additional shipping option to send the order as a gift.
This type of order requires providing an additional address and selecting gift wrapping._

Then add second requirement:
_Po złożeniu zamówienia i jego otrzymaniu przez klienta, ma on 30 dni na złożenie reklamacji._

## 15. Use case scenarios

A **use case scenario** is a detailed narrative that describes how a user (or actor) interacts with a system to
achieve a specific goal. It outlines the steps involved in a particular use case, including the actions taken by the
user, the system's responses, and any alternative paths or exceptions that may occur during the interaction.

Key components of a use case scenario include:

1. **Title:** A clear name for the use case that summarizes its purpose.
2. **Actors:** The users or external systems that interact with the system.
3. **Preconditions:** The conditions that must be met before the scenario begins.
4. **Main Flow:** The primary sequence of steps that the actor and the system follow to complete the use case
   successfully.
5. **Alternate Flows:** Variations or alternative paths that may occur, including error handling or exceptional
   cases.
6. **Postconditions:** The state of the system after the use case has been completed.

## 16. Different perspectives on requirements

Different perspectives on requirements and the system help ensure a comprehensive understanding of how the
system should operate and meet user needs.

### 16. 1. Data Perspective

The data perspective focuses on the information that the system manages. It examines how data is structured,
stored, and accessed within the system. Key considerations include:

### 16.2. Functional Perspective

The functional perspective looks at what the system is supposed to do. It defines the specific functions and
features that the system must provide to meet user needs and business objectives. Key aspects include:

### 16.3. Behavioral Perspective

The behavioral perspective focuses on how the system responds to various inputs and events over time. It
emphasizes the dynamic aspects of the system, including:

```
Data models (e.g., databases, entities, relationships).
Data integrity and consistency.
How data flows into, out of, and through the system. This perspective is crucial for ensuring that the system
can effectively handle and utilize the necessary information.
```

```
Functional requirements detailing specific tasks or operations.
User interactions with the system.
Use cases that describe how users will achieve their goals. This perspective is essential for outlining the
capabilities the system must deliver.
```

```
The system's responses to user actions or external events.
State transitions and workflows.
Performance under different scenarios and conditions. This perspective is important for understanding the
user experience and ensuring that the system behaves as expected in real-world situations.

## 17. UML

## 18. Class diagram

**Class Diagrams** are a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that depict the structure of a system by
illustrating the system's classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between them. Class diagrams
are fundamental in object-oriented design, providing a clear blueprint for the system's architecture.

## 19. Data flow diagram

**Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)** are graphical representations that illustrate the flow of data within a system. They
depict how data is input, processed, stored, and output, allowing stakeholders to understand how information
moves through the system. DFDs are widely used in system analysis and design, particularly during the initial
stages of developing a system or application.

## 20. Activity diagram

An **activity diagram** is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that represents the flow of activities
or tasks in a process. It visually depicts the sequence of actions, decision points, and the overall workflow within a
system or business process. Activity diagrams are particularly useful for modeling the dynamic aspects of a
system, showing how different actions are carried out in response to events or conditions.

## 21. State chart

```
Definition: A state chart is a more formalized or structured version of a state diagram, often used in UML
(Unified Modeling Language) to represent the dynamic behavior of a system or component.
Focus: It may incorporate more detailed information about events, actions, and guard conditions, providing a
more comprehensive view of the system's behavior.
```

## 22. State diagram

```
Definition: A state diagram (or state transition diagram) is a graphical representation of a finite state
machine, showing the states of an object and the transitions between those states.
Focus: It emphasizes the different states an object can be in and how it transitions from one state to another
in response to events or conditions.
```

## 23. Sequence diagrams

**Sequence Diagrams** are a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that illustrate how objects interact
in a particular scenario of a use case over time. They focus on the order of messages exchanged between objects
or components, providing a clear view of the sequence of events that occur during a specific interaction.
