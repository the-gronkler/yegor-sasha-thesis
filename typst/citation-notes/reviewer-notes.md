Reviewer warnings to note:

Fact 48: The thesis says Reverb is "built on Swoole" -- this may be incorrect (it likely uses ReactPHP). Worth verifying independently.
Fact 51: The "< 0.5% error" claim for ST_Distance_Sphere may not appear in MariaDB docs.
Fact 52: The "60fps" claim for Mapbox vector rendering is marketing-adjacent.
Facts 31/32: @PHP8Release is a weak citation for PHP deployment simplicity and pre-7.0 reputation claims.
