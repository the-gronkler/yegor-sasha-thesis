== Overview

The successful execution of a software engineering project of this scale necessitates a structured and disciplined development process. This chapter delineates the methodologies, tools, and workflows employed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure software quality, maintainability, and efficient collaboration.

The development approach integrates modern DevOps principles with rigorous academic documentation standards. The process is unified by an "Everything-as-Code" philosophy @GentleDocsLikeCode2017, extending beyond the application source code to include infrastructure definition, delivery pipelines, and the thesis manuscript itself.
