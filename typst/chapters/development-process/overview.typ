== Overview

The successful execution of a software engineering project of this scale necessitates a structured and disciplined development process. This chapter delineates the methodologies, tools, and workflows employed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure software quality, maintainability, and efficient collaboration.

The development approach integrates modern DevOps principles with rigorous academic documentation standards. The process is unified by an "Everything-as-Code" philosophy, extending beyond the application source code to include infrastructure definition, delivery pipelines, and the thesis manuscript itself.

The chapter is structured to cover the following core components of the workflow:

- *Planning and Tracking*: The strategies used to manage requirements and track progress.
- *Version Control*: The branching models and code review policies enforced to maintain repository health.
- *Quality Assurance*: The automated systems for static analysis, formatting, and testing.
- *Deployment*: The infrastructure and release pipelines used to host the application on the Microsoft Azure platform.
- *Documentation Engineering*: The application of software development tools (Typst, Git) to the writing of this thesis.
- *AI Augmentation*: The ethical and technical utilization of AI assistants in the development process.
