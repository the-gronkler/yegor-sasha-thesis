= Aim and Objectives

The primary aim of this project is to develop an order tracking and mobile order system tailored for small and medium-sized restaurants, particularly fast food outlets, that streamlines operations, enhances customer experience, and reduces dependency on expensive third-party solutions. This solution will provide an intuitive application for both customers and restaurant owners to manage the entire ordering process efficiently.

== Objectives

=== Customer Experience Enhancement
- Design an intuitive interface for customers to browse restaurant menus, place orders, and track their food in real time.
- Implement a "restaurant heatmap" feature, allowing users to seamlessly discover restaurants based on popularity, ratings, and proximity.
- Introduce gamified features like points, badges, and discount coupons to encourage repeat orders and enhance engagement.

=== Restaurant Operations Optimization
- Develop tools for restaurants to accept orders, flag unavailable dishes, and provide real-time status updates.
- Ensure that the restaurant-side tools are simple and intuitive, enabling straightforward integration into existing business processes with minimal staff training.

=== Customization and Scalability
- Ensure the system is customizable, allowing restaurants to adapt workflows and maintain operational control.
- Design a modular architecture that supports the possible addition of future functionality like loyalty programs or new payment gateways.

=== Cost Reduction
- Minimize costs for small restaurants by eliminating the reliance on third-party services and providing an affordable, in-house solution.

=== Technical Robustness
- Ensure the system is scalable, secure, and capable of handling many concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
