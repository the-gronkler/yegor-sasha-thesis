= Technologies Used

This chapter discusses the strategic technology choices made during the development of the restaurant ordering application. The focus is on the rationale behind selecting specific frameworks, libraries, and platforms—explaining *why* particular technologies were chosen, what alternatives were considered, and how these choices align with project requirements. This chapter provides a high-level, conceptual overview of technology decisions; implementation details and code-level specifics are covered in the Implementation chapter.
