= System Architecture

This chapter describes the high-level design and structure of the restaurant ordering system. The focus is on architectural patterns, component interactions, data flow, and design decisions that shape how the system is organized. Unlike the Implementation chapter (which details code structure and execution), this chapter explains the conceptual architecture - how major components fit together, how data flows through the system, and what architectural principles guide the design.
