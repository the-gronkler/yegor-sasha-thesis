= Introduction <introduction>

In @introduction you should explain the motivation behind your work, broad context of the work, and your inspirations. Explain the problem and how the path that you took deals with it.

A good introduction is usually written quite late in the thesis development, because throughout your work some important details may be subject to change.

Between chapters and sections (or subsections or subsubsections) always introduce few lines worth of a paragraph to introduce the topic. Avoid "gluing" higher- and lower-level sections. Always separate them using some text.

== Goals

Introduce the goals of the work. What kind of research and/or tool this work is supposed to produce.

== Conventions

Explain the conventions used in your work. For example, how do you deal with inline code or with code listings that contain lines which are too long to be rendered as a single one in this document.

== Results

Briefly introduce results of your work.

== Document structure

Explain how is your document structured by briefly summarizing all the chapters. This sections is usually filled in last.

== Example: Chapters, sections, subsections, and subsubsections <chapters>

Use appropriate commands to introduce chapters. Use enumerations or itemizations when it makes sense---it elevates the readability of your work. For example, here is how we introduce specific types of sections:
+ Top-level --- _chapters_. Use `= Heading` to introduce them.
+ Lower-level --- _sections_. Use `== Heading` to introduce them. For example, this very paragraph is a part of a section. Namely---@chapters.
+ Lowest-level --- _subsections_. Use `=== Heading` to introduce them.

== Styling

Here we will briefly explain the appropriate styling for theses. For starters, let us explain the difference between different dashes:

- Hyphens (-) are inputted by using a single `-` character. They are used to form interconnected words such as _low-level_ or _first-person_.
- En dashes (--) are inputted by using `--`. They are very rarely used. Mainly for specifying ranges, e.g.:
  - _pages 10--26_
  - _we are open 6:00 a.m.--9:00 p.m._
  - _saying those things was illegal in 1670--1680_
- Em dashes (---) are inputted by using `---`. They sometimes replace commas or changes of text direction, e.g.:
  - _This is very difficult---we are going to need to step down._
  - _My good friend---John Doe---turned out very successful._
