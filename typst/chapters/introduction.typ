= Introduction

This project is an order tracking and online ordering system designed specifically for smaller restaurants, especially fast food outlets, that want a simple, affordable solution without relying on expensive third-party services or complex in-house systems.

It offers a user-friendly web application where customers can browse the menu, place orders, and track their food in real time.

On the restaurant side, it handles order management, customer updates, and item availability tracking, making it easy for them to handle online and in-person orders efficiently.
This system streamlines operations, helps boost customer satisfaction, and is tailored to the needs of smaller businesses by providing low up-front costs and minimizing the effort required to integrate it into existing business processes.
