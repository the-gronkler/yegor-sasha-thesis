= Introduction <introduction>

In @introduction you should explain the motivation behind your work, broad context of the work, and your inspirations. Explain the problem and how the path that you took deals with it.

A good introduction is usually written quite late in the thesis development, because throughout your work some important details may be subject to change.

Between chapters and sections (or subsections or subsubsections) always introduce few lines worth of a paragraph to introduce the topic. Avoid "gluing" higher- and lower-level sections. Always separate them using some text.

== Goals

Introduce the goals of the work. What kind of research and/or tool this work is supposed to produce.

== Conventions

Explain the conventions used in your work. For example, how do you deal with inline code or with code listings that contain lines which are too long to be rendered as a single one in this document.

== Results

Briefly introduce results of your work.
