Small and medium-sized restaurants often struggle with the high commission fees and loss of brand control associated with third-party delivery platforms, yet they lack access to affordable, independent digital solutions due to prohibitive upfront costs. This thesis presents the design, implementation, and deployment of a self-hosted, full-stack online ordering and tracking system specifically tailored for these establishments. The solution provides a mobile-first interface for customers to discover restaurants via an interactive map, browse menus, and track orders in real time. Simultaneously, it equips restaurant operators with comprehensive tools for menu management, order fulfillment, and staff administration. Built on a modern stack utilizing Laravel, React, Inertia.js, and Docker, the system prioritizes modularity, cost-effectiveness, and scalability. The project demonstrates that a robust, production-grade ordering platform can be deployed independently, enabling small businesses to modernize their operations and regain ownership of their customer relationships without significant recurring costs.
