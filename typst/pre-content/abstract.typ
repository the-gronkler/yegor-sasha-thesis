Shortly describe what kind of problem has been inspected in the thesis, and how it has been solved. The abstract should be between 400 and 1500 characters, including spaces. *Thesis written in English must also include abstract and keyword translations to Polish*. Abstract should usually be written *towards the end* of your thesis work, since that is the time when you best know what (and how) exactly has been accomplished. *Pay extra attention and spend some extra time when developing an abstract.* This is due to the fact that most people will be glancing over your abstract in order to determine whether it is worth it for them to delve deeper into your work. This is the place where you need to attractively explain what can be found in this thesis. Do not introduce additional paragraphs in the abstract. The rest of this document describes general rules for writing theses documentations in PJAIT.
